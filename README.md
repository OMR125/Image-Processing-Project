# Image-Processing-Project  
this is an image proccesing project required by FCAI-CU as an assignemnt

the ass1.cpp file contains the functions to load and save 256x256 grayscale bitmap images as well as 15 unique filters that edit on the image   
it contains the following filters :  

black and white - invert - merge - flip - darken and lighten - rotate - detect image edges - enlarge - shrink - mirror - shuffle - blur - crop - skew up - skew right.  

the ass1-color.cpp file is the same program but works with 256X256 RGB bitmap picture

it works by taking the image name that has to be in the same file directory and then edits it depending on the user input and then procceds to save it
